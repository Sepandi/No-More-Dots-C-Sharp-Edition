# No-More-Dots-C-Sharp-Edition
My Old Game Port From Python ( Turtle ) to C# ( MonoGame )


i had made a game in python and turtle module named No More Dots . That you had to collect as much dots you can in only 30 sec !

but i reccently ported that to C# and MonoGame Framwork with Alot of More Features like : 
- Controller Support  
- a Menu ( old one didnt had a Menu ) 
- a Timer that shows you how much is left 
- Much smother motion 


Note : to reset your game press **esc** or (**Start** button on Xbox Controller or **Options** in PlayStation Controller ) then When You got to Main Menu Press **Enter** or **A** button ( on xbox ) or **X** ( on playstation ) to play the game again . when you get a game over you have to do this too .
